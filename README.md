This is a simple plugin for vim that allows you to open a file with a name matching the word under the cursor


## Installation ##

### Vundle (http://github.com/gmarik/vundle) ###

Include the following line in your .vimrc

    Bundle 'sjurgemeyer/vim-open'

Then, run

    :BundleInstall


### Pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) ###

Clone the plugin's git repository

    git clone git://github.com/sjurgemeyer/vim-open.git ~/.vim/bundle/vimport

You can also just copy the files the old fashioned way, but I don't condone that type of behavior


## Usage ##
Please see /doc/vim-open.txt for additional details on usage and configuration.
